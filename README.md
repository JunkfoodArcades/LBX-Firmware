# LBX-Melee
This code uses Nicohood's Nintendo library</br>
This code is original but based off of the concepts in Simple's DIY repository (from Jan 6 2017) as well as Crane's GCCPCB repository. Special thanks to both of those peeps! I am unaware of any direct lines of code that matches either of the above repositories, but generally willing to make changes here to ensure we are not copying someone else's work unintentionally. Also willing to send visitors to the main sources referenced above:</br>
https://github.com/SimpleControllers/SimpleControllersBuild-a-Box</br>
https://github.com/Crane1195/GCCPCB/tree/master/code/GCCPCB2-v1.209 (outdated, he has a new repo called CL-FW)</br>
Note: Values in our code were observed by flashing Crane's GCCPCB2 code to an arduino PCB and observing the values in "Visual Controller Test".</p>

This code is open source and instuctions for routine flashing, remapping and using it's features (switching to a Brook board) as well as a pinout for our LBX will be posted online.</br>
Modifications to adapt this code for other game types and protocols will be posted in separate files.</br>
Code that combines all game types and protocols has not been written.</br>
A license in line with other projects in this space is provided.</br>
